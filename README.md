# Migraine Prediction using Deep Learning

This project focuses on predicting migraine episodes using deep learning techniques applied to physiological signals such as heart rate, electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature.

## Project Description

* A dataset of 400 clinical records with 23 features was used.
* Deep learning models were developed and compared:

  * **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
  * **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
  * **Extended LSTM (XLSTM)**
* The **XLSTM model** achieved the highest accuracy of **94.38%**.
  
## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Output

* CNN Accuracy: 92.50%
* LSTM Accuracy: 91.25%
* XLSTM Accuracy: 94.38%

## Purpose

To enable early detection of migraine onset using wearable sensor data and improve real-time health monitoring.
